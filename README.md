# Python-Problem-Solving-Challenge
Beginner Level

Check if a number is even or odd: A simple function that determines whether a number is even or odd.

Calculate the factorial of a number: Implements a loop to calculate the factorial of a given number.

Reverse a string without built-in functions: Reverses a string by iterating through its characters.

Check if a string is a palindrome: Compares a string with its reverse to determine if it's a palindrome.

Print the Fibonacci sequence: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

Intermediate Level

Find the largest and smallest elements in a list: Iterates through a list to identify the largest and smallest values.
